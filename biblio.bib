   abstract = {<p>The purpose of this study is to establish the evolution and expose the trends of research in mathematics education between 1980 and 2019. The bibliometric analysis of the articles in Web of Science database indicated four-clustered structure. The first cluster covers the items related to the theoretical framework of mathematics education whereas the second cluster has the terms defining the methods for effective mathematics instruction. The third cluster includes the concepts interrelated to mathematics education while the fourth cluster encloses the studies about international mathematics assessments. The earlier studies look mathematics education mostly in students’ perspective and investigates generalization, restructuring, interiorization and representation. Between 1995 and 2010, curriculum and teacher-related factors were dominant in mathematics education studies. After 2010, the articles investigated specific topics and carried the traces from all stakeholders in mathematics education. The investigation on the trends of mathematics education would provide gain insight about the areas that need more research, contribute to the researchers, teachers, students and policy makers in this field and light the way ‎for further studies.</p>},

   abstract = {<p lang="en">Mathematical modeling is crucial in the field of education, particularly in mathematics, as it enhances students’ mathematical skills and prepares them for solving real-world problems. The study focuses on the challenges of teaching mathematical modeling, specifically in the Malaysian education system. We utilized a case study approach, involving five participants selected purposefully, comprising three females and two males. Data collection primarily involved interviews, with the collected data undergoing thematic analysis for a thorough examination. The process of conducting thematic analysis involves several systematic steps, including familiarization with the data, generation of initial codes, searching for themes, reviewing and refining these themes, defining and naming them, and ultimately producing a thematic map or report. We found Malaysian educators encounter difficulties in teaching mathematical modeling due to deficiencies in content and pedagogical knowledge, assessment methods, low student interest, and time constraints. This suggests a need for comprehensive reforms in curriculum design, professional development, assessment practices, and instructional strategies to enhance the effectiveness of mathematical modeling instruction.</p>},
