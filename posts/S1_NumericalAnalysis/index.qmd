Welcome to the world of Numerical Analysis! This field grew out of humanity's need to solve practical problems long before computers existed---think of ancient mathematicians approximating Ï€ or calculating astronomical orbits. Over time, pioneers like Newton, Euler, and Gauss developed systematic methods to approximate solutions when exact answers were impossible. Today, Numerical Analysis is the backbone of modern computing, enabling us to model, simulate, and solve problems across science and engineering.
