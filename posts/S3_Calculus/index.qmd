Calculus,
often called the \"mathematics of change,\" was born in the 17th century out of a
desire to understand motion, growth, and the infinite. Independently developed
by Isaac Newton and Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz, it gave humanity a new lens to
describe nature---from planetary orbits to flowing rivers. What began as a
revolutionary leap is now a cornerstone of modern science and engineering,
providing the foundation for countless discoveries and technologies.
