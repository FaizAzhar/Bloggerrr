    "text": "Salam & Hello everyone! I am Faiz.\nI had a very weird experience with Mathematics. When I was little, I hated the subject because in my school, teachers who were teaching Mathematics were fierce & fearful (sorry Mdm Asnah üôè- this is my first thought when seeing you). To add, it has become a school of thought during the old days that to become good in Mathematics, one need to repeatedly solve a lot of problems & exercises. The sentence ‚ÄòPractice Makes Perfect‚Äô and the word ‚Äòmemorizing‚Äô depicts perfectly the situation that I was living back in the day. I guess those were the primary reasons that make me hate the subject so much because everything about Maths seems theoretical and isolated.\nBut long story short, all these negative feelings have ignited my journey towards an endless pathway into the Mathematics world. Because as I tried to get out of the world, the more I was immersed into it. It was fascinating and weird. Hence, the purpose of me writing this blog is to share my little knowledge and experience about Mathematics and probably pulling interested readers to be lost together with me inside the Mathematics world. üòÉ"

This field grew out of humanity's need to solve practical problems long before computers existed‚Äîthink of ancient mathematicians approximating œÄ or calculating astronomical orbits. Over time, pioneers like Newton, Euler, and Gauss developed systematic methods to approximate solutions when exact answers were impossible. Today, Numerical Analysis is the backbone of modern computing, enabling us to model, simulate, and solve problems across science and engineering.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\nNumerical Analysis\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nNo matching items"

    "text": "Statistics and Probability arose from very human curiosities: games of chance, predicting outcomes, and understanding uncertainty. In the 16th and 17th centuries, thinkers like Cardano, Pascal, and Fermat laid the foundations of probability theory, while statistics evolved alongside the need to interpret population and economic data. Today, these tools have grown into a powerful language of data, helping us make informed decisions in science, business, and everyday life.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\nTwsting\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nnews\n\n\ncode\n\n\nanalysis\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSep 15, 2025\n\n\nHarlow Malloc\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNo matching items"
