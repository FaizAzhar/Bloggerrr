In the 16th and 17th centuries, thinkers like Cardano, Pascal, and Fermat laid the foundations of probability theory, while statistics evolved alongside the need to interpret population and economic data. Today, these tools have grown into a powerful language of data, helping us make informed decisions in science, business, and everyday life.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTwsting\n\n\n\nnews\n\ncode\n\nanalysis\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSep 15, 2025\n\n\nHarlow Malloc\n\n\n\n\n\nNo matching items"

    "section": "",
    "text": "Limits is fundamental in mathematics especially when dealing with scientific computing problem.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteDefinition (Limits)\n\n\n\n\nDefinition 1 (Limits) A function \\(f\\) defined on a set \\(X \\in \\mathbb{R}\\) has the limit \\(L\\) at \\(x_0\\), written\n\\[\\lim\\limits_{x \\to x_{0}} f(x) = L\\]\nif for any \\(\\epsilon &gt; 0\\), there exists \\(\\delta &gt; 0\\) such that\n\\[|f(x)-L| &lt; \\epsilon\\]\nwhen \\(0 &lt; |x-x_0| &lt;\\delta\\) AND \\(x \\in X\\).\n\n\n\nFor instance, let say we have a function \\(f(x) = \\sqrt[x]{x}\\), who knows the exact value of the function when \\(x=2\\) because its result is a real number with a never ending decimals? (\\(\\sqrt[2]{2} = 1.41421356...\\))\nAnd who knows that as \\(x\\to\\infty\\), the \\(f(x) \\to 1\\) although it is not exactly \\(1\\)?\nIn fact, we will never know the exact value of such number and the best approach that we can take is to make an approximation. With Definition¬†1, this can allow us to at least approximate the result and continue further the calculation that we are doing.\nContinuity is also an important concept in calculus because it enable us to find the rate change of any function in focus. Let say that at a certain point \\(x_i\\) with \\(f(x_i)=\\infty\\), then the rate change of the function cannot be determined at that point \\(x_i\\) because \\[\\frac{f(x_i)-f(\\Delta x)}{x_i - \\Delta x}\\] is not defined. We can say that any function is continuous if it fulfills the following criteria.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteDefinition (Continuity)\n\n\n\n\nDefinition 2 (Continuity) A function \\(f\\) defined on a set \\(X \\in \\mathbb{R}\\) is continuous if\n\\[\\lim\\limits_{x \\to x_{0}} f(x) = f(x_0)\\]\nat each number \\(x_0\\) in the set \\(X\\).\n\n\n\nSometimes, a function can be made from a sequence of number. For instance, consider the sequence \\(\\sqrt[1]{1}, \\sqrt[2]{2},\\sqrt[3]{3},...,\\sqrt[n]{n}\\), we can build a function out of this sequence such as\n\\[f(n)=\\frac{\\sqrt[1]{1}+\\sqrt[2]{2}+\\sqrt[3]{3}+...+\\sqrt[n]{n}}{n}.\\] For situation above, knowing that the sequence converge to \\(1\\) can be really helpful since we can approximate as \\(n \\to \\infty\\), the limit of \\(f(n) \\to 1\\). The following code snippet and image shows the value of the function as \\(n \\to \\infty\\).\n\nnumerator &lt;- function(N){\n  if(N==1){\n    return(1)\n  }\n  return(N^(1/N) + numerator(N-1))\n}\n\nfn &lt;- function(N){\n  return(numerator(N)/N)\n}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn fact, the concepts of convergence/divergence for sequence are very similar and mostly used interchangeably with the concept of limit.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteDefinition (Convergent of a sequence)\n\n\n\n\nDefinition 3 (Convergent of a sequence) If \\((x_n)\\) is a given sequence, and if it is related to a number \\(K\\), in such a way that \\[(x_n - K)\\] forms a null sequence (where all elements in the null sequence approaching 0), then we say that the sequence \\((x_n)\\) converges to \\(K\\). The number \\(K\\) is called the limiting value of this sequence.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteDefinition (Divergent of a sequence)\n\n\n\n\nDefinition 4 (Divergent of a sequence) Every sequence in which is not convergent (because we cannot form a null sequence) is called divergent.\n\n\n\nAt its core, the idea of limits helps us make sense of values that can‚Äôt be perfectly known ‚Äî only approached. Whether it‚Äôs finding where a function heads as it grows larger and larger, or figuring out if a sequence settles toward a single value, limits give us the language to describe ‚Äúalmost‚Äù and ‚Äúgetting closer.‚Äù\nOnce we understand limits, continuity becomes much more intuitive ‚Äî it‚Äôs simply when a function behaves smoothly without sudden jumps or breaks. And when we talk about convergence, we‚Äôre really seeing limits in action through sequences that gradually stabilize.\nThese ideas might seem abstract at first, but they‚Äôre the foundation of calculus and modern scientific computing. Every derivative, every integral, and every numerical approximation starts here ‚Äî with the simple yet powerful notion of approaching a value as closely as we want.\n\nReferences\n\n\nKonrad, Knopp. 1947.

    "text": "Salam & Hello everyone! I am Faiz.\nI had a very weird experience with Mathematics. When I was little, I hated the subject because in my school, teachers who were teaching Mathematics were fierce & fearful (sorry Mdm Asnah üôè- this is my first thought when seeing you). To add, it has become a school of thought during the old days that to become good in Mathematics, one need to repeatedly solve a lot of problems & exercises. The sentence ‚ÄòPractice Makes Perfect‚Äô and the word ‚Äòmemorizing‚Äô depicts perfectly the situation that I was living back in the day. I guess those were the primary reasons that make me hate the subject so much because everything about Maths seems theoretical and isolated.\nBut long story short, all these negative feelings have ignited my journey towards an endless pathway into the Mathematics world. Because as I tried to get out of the world, the more I was immersed into it. It was fascinating and weird. Hence, the purpose of me writing this blog is to share my little knowledge and experience about Mathematics and probably pulling interested readers to be lost together with me inside the Mathematics world. üòÉ"

    "section": "",
    "text": "Those born after the 1990s are, in many ways, a fortunate generation. We live in an era where technological advancements. The convenience and accessibility of modern tools make problem solving faster than ever but they also come with a hidden cost.\nLiving in such easy times often makes us take things for granted. We tend to overlook the long and difficult journey that led to the technologies and knowledge we now enjoy. The shortcuts we rely on, whether in the form of powerful computational tools or education systems that emphasize on results over understanding the ‚Äúwhy‚Äù behind them have made us less curious about the origins and motivations of the concepts we use.\nAs a result, many of us have become users rather than thinkers; we can apply existing methods, but we rarely question how or why they were developed. This mindset limits our ability to innovate more meaningful solutions that could once again push humanity forward.\nIn this post, let us take a step back and revisit one of the earliest and simplest numerical methods in history: the bisection method. By understanding its motivation and how it works, we can rekindle a bit of that appreciation for the thought and effort behind the tools we often take for granted.\nLet say we want to find the decimal numbers of \\(\\sqrt{2}\\), for most of us, it is easy right? Take a scientific calculator, just push in the \\(\\sqrt{}\\) and \\(2\\) button in a calculator and then push in the conversion button to decimal number. The answer \\(1.4142135..\\) should appear and we are done. Great! Well that is okay if you have a scientific calculator. But in case where you do not have one and need to convert \\(\\sqrt{2}\\) into decimal number, what are you going to do? If you are trying to develop your own computer with limited memory, are you going to hardcode the decimal numbers into your computer? I can guarantee that your computer will perform really slow compare to your brain.\nSo in this situation, we need use some basic trick that will allow us to at least approximate the irrational number. In our case, let say that we have found a number \\(x\\) that is the decimal number representation for \\(\\sqrt{2}\\), we can then write the following expression which is true.\n\\[x-\\sqrt{2}=0\\]\nWe can turn expression above into a function because we still do not know what decimal number the \\(x\\) should be. And this problem that we created just now is called the root-finding problem because it involves in finding a solution (root) of an equation of the form \\(f(x)=0\\).\nThe bisection method was a technique developed as far back to at least 1700 B.C.E. It works by repeatedly cut a number interval, say \\([a,b]\\), into half (bisecting) and at each step, finding the subinterval which containing the root.\nThe following algorithm is an example of the steps done in this technique. Note that this is not the exact method how computer was programmed to calculate \\(\\sqrt{2}\\).\n\nfn &lt;- function(x){\n  return(x - 2^(0.5))\n}\ni &lt;- 1; half_list &lt;- list()\n\n# initialize interval\na &lt;- 1; b &lt;- 2\n\n# begin Bisection method\nwhile(i &lt;= 500){\n  # cut into half\n  halfpoint &lt;- (a + b)/2\n  half_list &lt;- append(half_list, halfpoint)\n  # check which subinterval have positive & negative sign\n  if (fn(a) &lt; 0 & fn(halfpoint) &gt; 0){\n    a &lt;- a\n    b &lt;- halfpoint\n  } else if(fn(halfpoint) &lt; 0 & fn(b) &gt; 0){\n    a &lt;- halfpoint\n    b &lt;- b\n  }\n  i &lt;- i + 1\n}\n\nThe following are the halfpoints which were generated after 10 iterations. As you can see, the movement of the halfpoints are closer to the \\(\\sqrt{2}\\) (red vertical line) over the time.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy the end of the 500th iteration, we can see that the interval \\([a,b]\\) has now become so close to the exact value of \\(\\sqrt{2}\\).\n\n\nInterval at 500th iteration: [ 1.414214 , 1.414214 ]\n\n\nThe bisection method may appear simple, even primitive, when compared to the complex numerical solvers we have today. Yet, within its simplicity lies the foundation of many modern computational methods. It represents a time when mathematics was driven by curiosity, patience, and the desire to understand.\nThrough this humble method, we can appreciate how far human thought has come. Every algorithm we now use, no matter how sophisticated, stands on the shoulders of basic yet profound ideas like this. By revisiting the past, we remind ourselves that true progress is not merely about faster results, but about deeper understanding.\nAs learners in an age of convenience, we should strive to balance efficiency with comprehension and not only use the tools available to us but also to grasp the reasoning that shaped them. In doing so, we honor the spirit of discovery that brought us here and ensure that innovation continues to grow from understanding, not just automation.\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\nG√∂k√ße, Semirhan, and Pƒ±nar Guner. 2021. ‚ÄúForty Years of Mathematics Education: 1980-2019.‚Äù International Journal of Education in Mathematics, Science and Technology 9 (April): 514‚Äì39. https://doi.org/10.46328/ijemst.1361.\n\n\nHidayat, Riyan, Ahmad Fauzi Mohd Ayub, Harris Shah Abd Hamid, and Nurihan Nasir. 2025. ‚ÄúDifficulties in Instructing Mathematical Modeling: Case Study in Malaysia.‚Äù International Electronic Journal of Mathematics Education 20 (April): em0811. https://doi.org/10.29333/iejme/15815.\n\n\nL., Burden Richard, and Faires J.
