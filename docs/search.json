    "text": "Salam & Hello everyone! I am Faiz.\nI had a very weird experience with Mathematics. When I was little, I hated the subject because in my school, teachers who were teaching Mathematics were fierce & fearful (sorry Mdm Asnah üôè- this is my first thought when seeing you). To add, it has become a school of thought during the old days that to become good in Mathematics, one need to repeatedly solve a lot of problems & exercises. The sentence ‚ÄòPractice Makes Perfect‚Äô and the word ‚Äòmemorizing‚Äô depicts perfectly the situation that I was living back in the day. I guess those were the primary reasons that make me hate the subject so much because everything about Maths seems theoretical and isolated.\nBut long story short, all these negative feelings have ignited my journey towards an endless pathway into the Mathematics world. Because as I tried to get out of the world, the more I was immersed into it. It was fascinating and weird. Hence, the purpose of me writing this blog is to share my little knowledge and experience about Mathematics and probably pulling interested readers to be lost together with me inside the Mathematics world. üòÉ"

    "section": "",
    "text": "Limits is fundamental in mathematics especially when dealing with scientific computing problem.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteDefinition (Limits)\n\n\n\n\nDefinition 1 (Limits) A function \\(f\\) defined on a set \\(X \\in \\mathbb{R}\\) has the limit \\(L\\) at \\(x_0\\), written\n\\[\\lim\\limits_{x \\to x_{0}} f(x) = L\\]\nif for any \\(\\epsilon &gt; 0\\), there exists \\(\\delta &gt; 0\\) such that\n\\[|f(x)-L| &lt; \\epsilon\\]\nwhen \\(0 &lt; |x-x_0| &lt;\\delta\\) AND \\(x \\in X\\).\n\n\n\nFor instance, let say we have a function \\(f(x) = \\sqrt[x]{x}\\), who knows the exact value of the function when \\(x=2\\) because its result is a real number with a never ending decimals? (\\(\\sqrt[2]{2} = 1.41421356...\\))\nAnd who knows that as \\(x\\to\\infty\\), the \\(f(x) \\to 1\\) although it is not exactly \\(1\\)?\nIn fact, we will never know the exact value of such number and the best approach that we can take is to make an approximation. With Definition¬†1, this can allow us to at least approximate the result and continue further the calculation that we are doing.\nContinuity is also an important concept in calculus because it enable us to find the rate change of any function in focus. Let say that at a certain point \\(x_i\\) with \\(f(x_i)=\\infty\\), then the rate change of the function cannot be determined at that point \\(x_i\\) because \\[\\frac{f(x_i)-f(\\Delta x)}{x_i - \\Delta x}\\] is not defined. We can say that any function is continuous if it fulfills the following criteria.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteDefinition (Continuity)\n\n\n\n\nDefinition 2 (Continuity) A function \\(f\\) defined on a set \\(X \\in \\mathbb{R}\\) is continuous if\n\\[\\lim\\limits_{x \\to x_{0}} f(x) = f(x_0)\\]\nat each number \\(x_0\\) in the set \\(X\\).\n\n\n\nSometimes, a function can be made from a sequence of number. For instance, consider the sequence \\(\\sqrt[1]{1}, \\sqrt[2]{2},\\sqrt[3]{3},...,\\sqrt[n]{n}\\), we can build a function out of this sequence such as\n\\[f(n)=\\frac{\\sqrt[1]{1}+\\sqrt[2]{2}+\\sqrt[3]{3}+...+\\sqrt[n]{n}}{n}.\\] For situation above, knowing that the sequence converge to \\(1\\) can be really helpful since we can approximate as \\(n \\to \\infty\\), the limit of \\(f(n) \\to 1\\). The following code snippet and image shows the value of the function as \\(n \\to \\infty\\).\n\nnumerator &lt;- function(N){\n  if(N==1){\n    return(1)\n  }\n  return(N^(1/N) + numerator(N-1))\n}\n\nfn &lt;- function(N){\n  return(numerator(N)/N)\n}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn fact, the concepts of convergence/divergence for sequence are very similar and mostly used interchangeably with the concept of limit.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteDefinition (Convergent of a sequence)\n\n\n\n\nDefinition 3 (Convergent of a sequence) If \\((x_n)\\) is a given sequence, and if it is related to a number \\(K\\), in such a way that \\[(x_n - K)\\] forms a null sequence (where all elements in the null sequence approaching 0), then we say that the sequence \\((x_n)\\) converges to \\(K\\). The number \\(K\\) is called the limiting value of this sequence.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteDefinition (Divergent of a sequence)\n\n\n\n\nDefinition 4 (Divergent of a sequence) Every sequence in which is not convergent (because we cannot form a null sequence) is called divergent.\n\n\n\nAt its core, the idea of limits helps us make sense of values that can‚Äôt be perfectly known ‚Äî only approached. Whether it‚Äôs finding where a function heads as it grows larger and larger, or figuring out if a sequence settles toward a single value, limits give us the language to describe ‚Äúalmost‚Äù and ‚Äúgetting closer.‚Äù\nOnce we understand limits, continuity becomes much more intuitive ‚Äî it‚Äôs simply when a function behaves smoothly without sudden jumps or breaks. And when we talk about convergence, we‚Äôre really seeing limits in action through sequences that gradually stabilize.\nThese ideas might seem abstract at first, but they‚Äôre the foundation of calculus and modern scientific computing. Every derivative, every integral, and every numerical approximation starts here ‚Äî with the simple yet powerful notion of approaching a value as closely as we want."
